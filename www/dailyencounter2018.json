But her life had not always been \\'wonderful.\\' She\r\nhad lost two husbands: the first, missionary Jim Elliot was\r\nkilled by the Auca Indians in Ecuador while he was trying to reach them with the Gospel. The second, Addison Leitch, died\r\nof cancer. In telling these experiences, Elliot said, \u201cIn the first shock of death, everything that has seemed most dependable has given way. Mountains are falling, earth is reeling. In such a\r\ntime, it is a profound comfort to know that although all things\r\nseem to be shaken, one thing is not: God is not shaken.\u201d\r\nElliot\\'s confidence in God in the midst of her troubles is similar to the psalmist\u2019s trust in God.\r\nWhen King David wrote Psalm 56, he was in the midst of crisis (cf.1 Samuel 21:10-15). Many\r\ntake this psalm as an individual lament, but it could also be a psalm of anticipated thanksgiving.\r\nThe description of troubles and prayers changed into gratitude that God has heard and will act.\r\nWhen it looked like he would be swallowed up, the psalmist trusted God.<em> \u201cWhen I am afraid, I\r\nwill trust in you. ... I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?\u201d<\/em>(vv. 3-4)\r\n<\/p>\r\n        \r\n<p> Regardless of your previous experiences, this year, God wants you to trust Him\r\nabsolutely. You may not know what the year holds, but with your trust in the God who\r\nknows the end from the beginning, you will have a fruitful\r\nyear. God is forever trustworthy because He is faithful. Let go of all your fears, and trust Him every step of the way. And\r\nHe will surely act on your behalf. Have a trust-filled year!\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>  Trusting God brings stability in the midst of troubles.<\/p>\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Are you willing to put your absolute trust in God this year? <\/p>\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Make a list of those situations that bring fear, and trust them to God to handle. <\/p>\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b> Heavenly Father, I trust my life and family to you this year.

His was not a prayer-in-passing, but a fervent prayer, pleading in humility of sackcloth and ashes, with an empty stomach aching for food.

At a point, he addressed the police, \u201cYou are powerful. You are very powerful, but you are not gods and I serve a God who cannot be mocked. So, since you\\'ve already lost, I invite you today to come and join the winning side!\u201d\r\nThe task before Ezekiel was tough \u2013 to go to a people who were obstinate, stubborn and rebellious. He fell to\r\nhis face when he saw the glory of God and heard Him speak. He was commanded to stand up and hear God\\'s specific instructions. The Holy Spirit entered into Ezekiel to prepare him for the intimidating task of speaking to the\r\nrebellious Israelites. God chose the man, equipped him\r\nand the Holy Spirit would go with him. Ezekiel had everything he needed for success. There was no reason to fear; God was on his side, preparing the way for him.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nPhilips Brooks said, \u201cDon\\'t ask for tasks equal to your powers.

One Sunday morning he decided to go to a church.\r\nAs he made to enter the church, he was stopped by some ushers who told him that the church was for high- caste Indians and whites only. They told Gandhi to seek a church where his own people worshipped. He left and never went back. He said, \u201cIf Christians have caste differences also, I might as well remain a Hindu.\u201d Brother James emphasised that keeping the royal law of love requires that we treat people equally and fairly. James\r\nwas speaking against the error of treating people who are rich better than those who are poor in the church of God. He stated that the act of dishonouring the poor in the church to honour the wealthy, who came from outside, is a sin. When the royal law of love is violated, it is a violation of all other laws.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nNot many people like to associate with poor people.

The admonition of James is that if that is what obtains in the world, the Church should set the right example by treating everyone equally, regardless of their economic status or any other basis by which we discriminate against people. Partiality or favouritism violates the Royal Law. Treating the rich better than the poor goes against loving your neighbour as yourself.

In a world such as this, the Scripture warns us against being desperate\r\nfor money by desiring to get it at all costs. Paul told Timothy that those who want to get rich fall into snares and temptations which can plunge their soul to ruin.\r\nWhen people are desperate for money, nothing else matters. The only thing that matters is to get money \u2013 whether through crooked or noble means.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 3-->\r\n<p>\r\nMoney is good when it serves God\\'s purpose and it does not make us drift away from God. But Christians should live above materialism. We should not run after\r\nmoney to the detriment of enriching our souls for the life to come. Proverbs 10:2 says, \u201cIll-gotten treasures are of no value.\u201d In the long run, what matters most is not\r\nacquiring more money, but godliness and contentment which is great gain (1Timothy 6:6).\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>   Godliness with contentment is great gain.         <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Using the Gospel to extort money from others is sin. <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Eliminate everything that borders on preference for worldly gain over dedication to Christ. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>  L o r d, remind me always that serving You is more important than pursuing money.          <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\r\n\r\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\r\n\r\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\r\n Mgbemere Cornelius, Okwelle; M.

Faith obeys God\\'s instruction\r\neven when it doesn\\'t make sense. Abraham was willing to sacrifice Isaac, at God\\'s command, though he knew that he needed a son for his lineage to continue. He practically believed God could raise Isaac from the dead.\r\nAnd God honoured his faith; preserved his lineage by providing a replacement ram for the life of Isaac.

The music they produce is often one that\r\ntranscends the barriers of language, and can transform listeners and viewers from the natural to the supernatural.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nIn 2 Chronicles 29 we find Hezekiah succeeding his father, Ahaz. Though Ahaz had denigrated the worship of Yahweh, Hezekiah came as a reformer. He arranged for a special worship of\r\nGod as he assembled the priest and the people, purified the temple and asked officials to bring animals for a sin and burnt offering. Hezekiah made elaborate preparation for the\r\nworship of God by appointing the Levites with different instruments of music. He positioned the Levites in the temple with cymbals, harps, and lyres (v.25); as the Levites stood, ready with David\\'s\r\ninstruments, the priests stood with their trumpets. As the offering began, the people sang to the Lord, accompanied by instruments, and the whole assembly bowed down in worship. \u201cSo they sang\r\npraises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshipped\u201d (v. 30b). Hezekiah did so in obedience to all the commands that the Lord had given to King David.\r\n<\/p>\r\n    \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 3-->\r\n<p> \r\nWe will achieve much when we all work together like musicians in an orchestra to produce inviting and lifetransforming sounds to the world around us.

This is an indication that the worship that the Lord seeks is one that focuses more on the state of our heart than the\r\nmagnanimity of our outward activities. True religion, according to Jesus, is not one that claims that once God is pleased, it does not matter if our fellow brother\r\nor sister is displeased.

But today\\'s\r\npassage makes it clear that it was nothing like\r\nhallucination. After two prior appearances to the\r\ndisciples after His resurrection, Jesus again appeared to\r\nthem at the sea of Tiberias. Perhaps still disillusioned\r\nabout what next to do after Jesus\\' resurrection, Peter\r\ntold the other disciples of his intention to go back to\r\nfishing. Because he was the leader of the group, others\r\ndecided to follow him. Having toiled all night, with\r\nnothing to show for it, the disciples must have resigned\r\nto fate. Then, Jesus appeared to them on the shore. They\r\ndid not recognise Him at first, but after Jesus had given\r\nthem direction as to where to catch fish, John was able\r\nto identify Him. Jesus did not only help them to catch\r\nmultitude of fishes, He also provided breakfast for\r\nthem. This is another confirmation that Jesus rose bodily from the grave.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nNutrition experts have emphasised the importance\r\nof breakfast to the body, especially to growing children.\r\nSince it is the first meal of the day, it replenishes the\r\nenergy already spent during the night. Jesus\\' eating of\r\nbreakfast with the disciples is symbolic. Just as\r\nphysical breakfast re-launches us into a new day, the\r\nsame way Jesus re-commissions the disciples. A daily\r\nbreakfast from Jesus also helps to launch you into the\r\nday. A life of self-sufficiency and service outside\r\nChrist, no matter how sincere, will bring no reward. On\r\nthe other hand, a life connected to the Lord enjoys\r\ndivine provision, guidance for success and the peaceful\r\npresence of the Master. Depending on the risen Lord for\r\neverything will definitely ensure a bright and beautiful\r\nday, any day. Peter was restored and re-commissioned\r\nafter the breakfast.

Thomas\r\nwas on a journey, and he had a moment of doubt about Jesus\\'\r\nresurrection. But it is comforting to note that he did not\r\nremain in doubt.

Later, He sent out seventy-two out of His disciples\r\nwith the same message of good news to the world (Luke 10:1-9, NIV). The\r\nMessage translation renders verse 5-7 this way: \u201cDon\\'t begin by traveling to some\r\nfar-off places to covert unbelievers. And don\\'t try to be dramatic by tackling some\r\npublic enemies. Go to the lost, confused people right here in the neighbourhood.\r\nTell them that the kingdom (of God) is here.\u201d\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nWe need to be deliberate about proclaiming the good news,\r\nbeginning from our neighbourhood.

Paul said that their gift was not only a gift to\r\nhim but something that was credited to their account.\r\nHe called their gift \u201can odour of a sweet smell, a\r\nsacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.\u201d So when Paul prayed that God shall\r\nsupply all their needs according to His riches in glory in Christ, we can better\r\nidentify with the import of that prayer.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nFor our giving to be a \u201cfragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to\r\nGod\u201d, we must be committed to giving, to meet specific needs of the gospel.\r\nWhatever we give to the work of the Lord is credited to our account and translates\r\nto a pleasing sacrifice before the Lord.

While they do this, the workers suffer and\r\ngroan under the hardship that this practice brings.

The fact that money is an everyday\r\nnecessity is undeniable. Everyone needs money to live\r\nand support their families. Having money is not evil but\r\nthe love of it leads to evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Love of\r\nmoney leads to hoarding it and the Scripture warns\r\neveryone fond of hoarding wealth to expect God\\'s\r\njudgment. The danger of hoarding wealth is that the soul\r\nis never satisfied. The more a person keeps money without spending it, the more the\r\nurge to keep.

We receive forgiveness as long as we are\r\nwilling to forgive others.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nWhen family members forgive one another,\r\nfreedom of interaction is restored. When we refuse to \r\nforgive, we are hypocrites because we are asking God to do for us what we are not\r\nwilling to do for others. Gratitude for our cancelled debts should make us willing\r\nto let go of other people\\'s wrongdoings against us. It may be difficult, but families who forgive flourish.\r\nPhilip Yancey said, \u201cIn the final analysis, forgiveness is\r\nan act of faith. By forgiving another, I am trusting that\r\nGod is a better justice-maker than I am. By forgiving, I\r\nrelease my own right to get even and leave all issues of\r\nfairness for God to work out. I leave in God\\'s hands the\r\nscales that must balance justice and mercy.\u201d A heart that\r\nis bitter towards anyone is also closed towards God. The\r\nimplication is that I cannot pray or even when I pray, my\r\nprayer lacks power. A heart that forgives others is the\r\none that can relate freely with God.

The assertion of the religious leaders is that if a man\r\nswears by the gold on the altar he is bound by oath but if he\r\nswears by the altar itself it means nothing. They valued the\r\nmaterial things over the sacred. They failed to understand\r\nthat the most important thing is the temple, not the items in\r\nthe temple. What consecrates temple items is the fact that they are in the temple, so it is\r\nwrong to swear by the temple or by the temple\\'s items. The Pharisees had a wrong\r\nunderstanding about events and taught others the same.

The Acts chapter 6 scenario,\r\nwhich became a reference point for the selection of\r\ndeacons in churches, shows that the disciples considered\r\ntaking care of widows a responsibility that must be deliberately carried out. That\r\nwas why they appointed deacons to take it up. The recommendations of the apostle\r\nthat some brethren should be chosen to take care of the widows pleased the\r\ncongregation and they selected the people.

His reaction to Jesus\\' instruction to go and\r\nsell all that he had and give to the poor showed that he\r\nhad another god in his life __ his wealth. He was full of\r\nsorrow because he was very rich, and was so attached\r\nto his riches.\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jesus\\' statement \u201cHow hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d mean?\r\nIs Jesus condemning being rich? No. Jesus only affirmed the natural tendency to get carried\r\naway with riches at the expense of knowing God or serving Him. With many riches, one has\r\nthe tendency to be proud or trust in one\\'s riches rather than God.\r\nBut Jesus said that we can be rich towards God(Luke 12:21).\r\nBeing rich towards God makes it easy to share our possessions\r\nwith those who are in need. Jesus\\' parable of the rich man and\r\nLazarus shows us that though riches can give us all the comfort\r\nwe want in this world, it cannot guarantee us a place in heaven.\r\nApostle Paul states that, \u201cthose who want to get rich fall into\r\ntemptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires\r\nwhich plunge men into ruin and destruction.

The first is that we should walk in Him. Paul reminds the Colossian\r\nChristians that since they have received Christ the Lord,\r\nthey should walk in Him. The idea of walking is used as a\r\nmetaphor for the manner in which a Christian should live; it\r\nincludes the actions, attitudes and motivations of a\r\nChristian, all of which should be centred on Christ. Another\r\nphrase is to be rooted and built up in Him, and established\r\nin the faith. The stamina to sustain the outward growth of\r\nany plant is in the root. So, Paul is suggesting that if we\r\nmust grow in Christ, then we must establish ourselves in\r\nHim. Being rooted in Christ involves praying and feeding\r\nour hearts and minds with the Word of God so much that it\r\ntakes over the centre of our imagination. Then we begin to\r\nmanifest the fruit of the Spirit. When we are rooted in Christ, we would be able to\r\ndiscern those who take people captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy (v. 8)\r\nand would not fall prey to them.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nPaul also said that believers have been circumcised\r\nin Christ. For the Jews, physical circumcision was a\r\nsymbol of being set apart as a people unto God. That we\r\nare circumcised in Christ then means that we have cut off\r\nthe foreskin of flesh and have been set apart to live a new\r\nlife, pleasing Him alone. Another metaphor that Paul\r\nused is that we are buried with Christ in baptism and are\r\nrisen with Him in faith. Baptism reminds us of our union\r\nwith Christ in His death and resurrection by which we\r\nreceive the power of God to live a new life. In baptism, we\r\nbury the old life of sin and rise of to a new life of\r\nrighteousness, which is lived for Christ alone at all times.\r\n<\/p>\r\n                        \r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>   It is impossible to carry Christ\\'s life and not live in a Christlike way.         <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Are you dead to sin and alive to Christ? <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Being buried in baptism means death to self; be dead to self today. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>  Open my eyes Lord, to turn a new leaf today.          <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\r\n\r\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\r\n\r\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\r\n Ejigberekor Samuel E, Okwemor, Delta; Oyawale\r\nE.

The implication of putting off these is that they do not identify us as\r\nChristians. Anger and rage are both destructive emotions expressed out-ofcontrol.\r\nMalice is animosity or an intent to injure someone. Slander is making a\r\nfalse statement about someone with the intent to damage their reputation.

The command to\r\ngive thanks is repeated in verses 1, 2, and 3, each time\r\nwith the same reason given - \"for His love endures forever\".\r\nBelievers need to be constantly reminded of God\\'s goodness because the enemy often tries to get us to doubt\r\nit, especially in times of troubles. In addition, the psalmist\r\nurged us to give thanks for God\\'s power in creation,\r\nwhich displays His everlasting love. The psalmist shows\r\nus why God created the world. The creation is an\r\nundeniable proof of God\\'s love for humankind. And this\r\nlove is unconditional. Jesus said God makes the sun to\r\nrise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just\r\nand unjust (Matthew 5:45). The wonders of God\\'s\r\ncreation should cause us to give thanks to Him and\r\nmarvel at His everlasting love that made these wonders so\r\nthat we would worship Him.\r\n<\/p>\r\n                  \r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b> Living on earth is dwelling in the midst of God\\'s love.           <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Do you experience the love of God through the wonders of nature and thank Him for it?  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Always give thanks to the Lord, because His lovingkindness is everlasting. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>    Lord, make me a transmitter of Your love in the world.        <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\r\n\r\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\r\n\r\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\r\n S.

Both man and woman must obey God\\'s instruction for marriage if they\r\nwill fulfil God\\'s purpose. Anything short of that is not God\\'s standard. Marriage is a\r\nre-enactment of the design of God for creation.

The permission for divorce in the\r\nScriptures indicates that people failed to live up to the\r\nmodel of God, though this did not in any way bring the\r\napproval of God upon failed marriages.

The \u201chand\u201d refers to \u201cthe things we do.\u201d\r\nThe \u201cfoot\u201d refers to \u201cthe places we go.\u201d The \u201ceye\u201d refers\r\nto \u201cthe things we see or desire to have.\u201d They describe\r\nall the areas where humans are tempted to sin, (1 John\r\n2:16; Genesis 3:6). However, Jesus is not asking us to\r\nmutilate our bodies but He used these illustrations to\r\nemphasise the horrible nature of sin. Anyone who acts\r\nin a manner that makes children, the powerless, or those\r\nwho are weak in the faith to fall away is in danger.\r\nChrist\\'s disciples must not lose their effectiveness and\r\nmust follow Jesus consistently and honestly.\r\n<\/p>\r\n                        \r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b> Every heaven-bound pilgrim travels light.           <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> Is your life obstructing some people from following Jesus?  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Make sure you do not hinder others from following Jesus. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b> O Lord, may my life not become a stumbling block to those following You.           <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\r\n\r\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\r\n\r\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\r\n Olaogun N.

Whenever you see the rainbow, remember God\\'s mercy and a\r\npromise of a better day. The token of God\\'s final covenant with humanity is the blood of\r\nHis dear Son Jesus Christ, shed for the remission of our sins. All other covenants\r\nculminated in Christ. In Him we have hope that even when all\r\nof life is destroyed and everything comes to an end, there is a\r\nglory that awaits us which surpasses all of the troubles that we\r\nmight have faced on this side of eternity. God said to the\r\nIsraelites, \u201cWhen I see the blood I will pass over you.\u201d The\r\nblood of Jesus is the sure token you have to be spared from the\r\ndestruction that would come when everything comes to an\r\nend.

The author of Hebrews says, \u201cDo not neglect to\r\nshow hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have\r\nentertained angels unawares. Remember those who are\r\nin prison, as though in prison with them, and those who\r\nare mistreated, since you also are in the body\u201d (13:2-3).\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b> Giving with the aim of receiving is business, not charity.           <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b> How hospitable am I to strangers? <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Choose one orphan or orphanage that you will be committed to helping every month. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>  Lord, help us to be a family that shows your love to others.          <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\r\n\r\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\r\n\r\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\r\n Olayiwola A.

He thought he was the last man standing and there was no need for him to continue living. There, he asked God to take his life. In his despair, he slept off under the tree. At that point, an angel woke him up twice to eat and he was strengthened.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> The angel\\'s touch changed Elijah\\'s story and brought refreshing and renewal to his soul. God\\'s touch always brings renewal to a weary soul. Are you going through a wilderness experience? Is your life threatened in any way? Are there some challenges you are facing and you think God has\r\nforgotten you? Any time you feel threatened and deserted, remember that our gracious Lord never loses sight of us. We only need to trust in Him and He will show Himself mighty in our situation. Whenever you are at crossroads, trust in His guidance. Will you ask for His touch today?\r\n<\/p>                        \r\n\r\n<p><b> Wisdom : <\/b>    He  that has   called   will never abandon us in the face of trials.        <\/p>  <!--WISDOM CONTENT-->\r\n<p><b> Food for Thought : <\/b>  <\/p> <!--FOOD FOR THOUGHT-->\r\n<p><b> Follow-up Action : <\/b> Resolved to call upon God for deliverance from every ravaging storm. <\/p> <!--FOLLOW UP ACTION-->\r\n<p><b> Prayer : <\/b>     O Lord, come to my rescue and deliver me from life   threatening situations.       <\/p> <!--PRAYER-->\r\n\r\n<hr> <!--DO NOT TOUCH-->\r\n\r\n<!--PRAYER FOR PASTORS AND ALL-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n <b>Pray for these ordained ministers and members of their churches:<\/b>\r\n Samson Kayode Omotoso, Lagos; Taunu Erukeoghene, P\/Harcourt; Joshua Olayide Ojo, Lagos; Adetayo Tayo, Ibadan; S.

The  preceding chapters centred on God\\'s judgment for the sins of\r\nHis people. Here, we see God\\'s promise of comfort to souls wearied and depressed by the burden of oppression. The message came at a time when the people of God had started having a feeling of being neglected and forgotten by God (v. 27). Isaiah challenged them to renew their hope in God.

When we don\\'t tithe, we shirk a just debt. Actually we are not giving when we give God one-tenth, for it belongs to Him\r\nalready. This is a debt we owe.\u201d\r\nThe Lord instructed the Israelites to bring to Him\r\none-tenth of the increase of their seeds. This special\r\ntithing is to be accompanied with a time of feasting and\r\ncelebration before the Lord. An important part of the\r\ncelebration is to make provision for the Levites, the\r\nstranger,  the  fatherless,  and  the  widows  in  the\r\ncommunity. God stated that the purpose for this is \u201cso that you may learn to\r\nrevere the LORD your God always\u201d (v. 23). Giving is an\r\nacknowledgement that our whole being and all that we\r\npossess ultimately belongs to the Lord. God asked the\r\npeople to make provision for the Levites because they\r\nare fully devoted to God\\'s work.

Nathaniel was amazed at Jesus\\' perfect description of him, and he also came to believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the King of When Jesus Christ described (v. 49).

As Jesus told Nathaniel, believers should continually long to have a greater experience with the Master as we mature in the faith.\r\nThere is more to God than a casual knowledge of who He is. But God does not force Himself on us. Seeing Him in greater ways and\r\nknowing Him more intimately requires a deliberate commitment to studying His Words, earnest prayer, and a willigness to listen in for the still small voice of His Spirit in us; and then obey.

But Jesus always lived above their schemes. On\r\none occasion, a lawyer asked him a question to tempt Him. He wanted to know which is the greatest commandment in the law (v. 36). As a reply to this question, Jesus gave a summary of the whole law. Jesus said to him, \u201c\\'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\\' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \\'Love your neighbor as yourself.\\' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d (vv. 37-40) By this response, Jesus established that love is the whole\r\nessence of the law \u2013 love for God and fellow humans. The spirit of all the commandments given to the Israelites is the spirit of love. If only they could love God wholeheartedly and others as themselves.

Apostle John says we cannot claim to love God who we cannot see when we find it difficult to love people that we can see (1\r\nJohn 4:20). Love towards one another springs from the love of God as its source. Thomas a\\' Kempis said, \u201cWhoever loves much, does much.\u201d When we love God genuinely, our love for Him will be seen in actions of obedience to His words.

Jesus demonstrated love in dealing with people without bias. Therefore, relationships must be built on fair treatment of others as oneself. Love becomes the royal law through which all human conducts are monitored. It becomes the guiding principle upon which human relationships are established.

God created us to live in the midst of others, and for us to fulfil our purpose for living, we must be mindful of what it takes to have good relationships. The first law about relating with people goes to the children, who are commanded to honour their father and mother. This law comes with a promise of long life for those who obey it. The commandment not to steal, kill, commit adultery, bear false witness or\r\ncovet what belongs to others, shows that God is concerned about the way treat\r\nothers and the effect our actions have on them.

Numerous stories in the book of Judges show what Israel had to suffer because of their failure to follow God whole-heartedly. Our failure to follow God will result to grave consequences.

When we are confronted by tribulation, distress, persecution, nakedness, peril, sword or other challenges of\r\nlife, what do we do? Where do we run to?

The woman\r\nwas seen sighing and hanging up when someone called to report a robbery, dangerous driving and homicide. Her supervisor noticed her call logs were filled with short conversations lasting around 20 seconds or less. When she was questioned by investigators as to why she was disconnecting the calls, she said she \u201cdid not want to talk to anyone at that time\u201d. Even a 911 officer\r\ncould be distressed. It is then comforting to note that God does not disconnect our calls anytime we call Him. He is above all situations, cannot be moved by them, and that is why He is always ready to listen to us. The psalmist expresed an assured trust in God to answer him in the day of trouble. Troubles are part of the fallen world, and as much as we would like to be trouble-free all the time, we discover that they are inevitable. The psalmist pleaded earnestly with God to answer him, guard his life, save him, have mercy on him, bring joy to him and hear his prayer. God\\'s goodness is evident in that He is forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call on Him. The Scripture\r\nsays, \u201cThose who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever.\u201d (Psalm 125:1) Our trouble or pain could be so great, but we should never let them prevent us from crying out to God like the psalmist. And when we feel there is no relief in sight, all we can do is to acknowledge the greatness of God and wait for better days ahead.

Christians must embrace the truth of the Gospel by their speech and actions. We must know the truth; live it and defend it. We walk in the truth when we fulfil our promises; speak truthfully about others and are truthful in our business dealings.

Before now, Moses had gone\r\nto Mount Sinai, where God gave him two tablets of the testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God. But as Moses was coming down from the mountain, he saw that the Israelites had made for themselves a golden calf and worshipped it. Then his anger burnt within him and he threw the tablets out of his hand, breaking it into pieces at the foot of the mountain. In today\\'s text, The Lord ordered Moses to prepare two new tablets; this meant he was going to replace the tablets that Moses had broken.\r\nGod said to Moses, \"Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on\r\nthem the words that were on the first one, which you broke.\" So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him. When he got up the mountain with the two tablets in his hands, the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed His name. God proclaimed His attribute (vv. 5-7) as One who abounds in steadfast love. Moses repeated these words to God at Kadesh-Barnea (Numbers\r\n14:17-19), the Jews used them in Nehemiah\\'s days (Nehemiah 9:17-18) and Jonah quoted them when he expressed his displeasure outside Nineveh (Jonah 4:1-2).\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nGod still remains the same today.

Moses said, \u201cIf you put these people to death all at once, the nations who have heard this report about you would say, \\'The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.\\'\u201d (vv. 15-16) Secondly, Moses argued because of the covenant God had made\r\nwith the patriarchs years before (v. 16). The Lord had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give them the land, and He could not go back on His word (Genesis 13:17; 15:7-12; 28:13; 35:12). Moses\\'\r\nthird argument was on the character of God (Numbers\r\n14:17-18; Exodus 34:6-7). He reminded God of His promise saying, \u201cNow may the Lord\\'s strength be displayed, just as you have declared: The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion ....\\' He further challenged God that in accordance with His great love, He should forgive the sin of Israelites just as He had pardoned them since they left Egypt until then.

Jesus then set a child before them and explained that the way to be first is to be last and the way to be last is to be the servant of all. The innocent child is an example of submission and humility. A child knows he is a child and acts like a child\r\nand that is his secret of attracting love and care. A child who tries to impress people by acting like an adult does not get the same attention. In like manner, we should not regard ourselves as better than or more superior to others. We should be humble in spite of our achievements in life. Humility is one of the attributes of a true child of God. The Scripture admonishes us in Philippians 2:3-4 that we should do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than ourselves. Each of us should look not only to our own interests, but also to the interests of others.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n<!--PARAGRAPH 2-->\r\n<p> \r\nTrue humility means knowing yourself, accepting yourself, being yourself and giving of yourself for others.

First, the bridegroom and his friend would go from his house to claim the bride from her parents.

Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy\r\nsome for yourselves.\\' While they were on their way to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went inwith him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut. This suggests that not every churchgoer will make heaven, for some really have not trusted God, and therefore, are not saved. Jesus ended this parable with the warning He had spoken before: \u201cwatch\u201d (Matthew 24:42; 25:13).
